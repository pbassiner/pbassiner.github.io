Let's setup a simple multi-project build using `sbt`, assuming we're already familiar with regular *single-project* builds.

# Goal
We have two *deliverable* sub-projects (`multi1` and `multi2`) and a *common-stuff* sub-project (`common`) on which they both depend on.

To simplify development and maintenance we can use a single `build.sbt` file which allows for centralized configuration, dependency and build management.

Then each sub-project contains nothing but its source code, while they can depend on other sub-projects.

Finally, we only need to generate artifacts for *deliverable* sub-projects.

# File structure
This is the project file tree:

* sbt-multi-project-example/
    * common/
        * src/
        * test/
    * multi1/
        * src/
        * test/
    * multi2/
        * src/
        * test/
    * project/
        * build.properties
        * plugins.sbt
    * build.sbt

# Build configuration
Our build file will include all the configuration we need:
* Sub-projects definition
* Build settings
* Dependencies
* Artifacts generation

## Projects definition
First of all we define our projects:
* `global`: the parent project, aggregating the others
* `common`: where the common code is
* `multi1` and `multi2`: the two *deliverables*, which depend on `common`

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=projects.sbt"></script>

Using  `aggregate` in `global` implies that running a task on the aggregate project will also run it on the aggregated ones. On the other hand, using `dependsOn` sets the code dependency between sub-projects.

By default, dependency is set for the `compile` configuration. If we'd need to also depend on the `test` configuration (i.e. we have tests depending on other sub-project's test source code), we'd need to define dependency as follows: `common % "compile->compile;test->test"`.

Since the `global` project is in the project root folder, we need to explicitly specify it using `in(file(".")`. There's no need to do so with the other sub-projects since they are located in a folder with the same name.

## Settings
We can setup some global settings as follows:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=globalSettings.sbt"></script>

Settings that are subject to change can be defined as values that can later be used by each sub-project. Here we're defining the Scala compiler options and some extra repositories:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=settings.sbt"></script>

Then we can use them in the sub-projects:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=settingsInProjects.sbt"></script>

## Dependencies
We'll follow the same strategy with the dependencies. First we define our catalog of dependencies:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=dependencies.sbt"></script>

Then we identify the common ones used by all sub-projects:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=commonDependencies.sbt"></script>

And finally we define each sub-project's dependencies combining the common with the specific ones:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=dependenciesInProjects.sbt"></script>
The parent project, `global`, needs no dependencies since it has no code at all. The other sub-projects have the common dependencies along with some specific ones: `multi1` requires `monocle` and `multi2` requires `pureconfig`.

## Artifacts generation
To generate artifacts for our *deliverable* sub-projects we'll use [sbt-assembly](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-assembly) to produce a *fat-jar* (if we'd need to generate Docker images we could use [sbt-native-packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager) instead).

First we define the corresponding settings:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=sbtAssemblySettings.sbt"></script>

And then we add them **only** to the settings of our *deliverable* sub-projects `multi1` and `multi2`:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/5ec3209743f42b3f67fbb54b72b446f4.js?file=sbtAssemblySettingsInProjects.sbt"></script>

## Putting it all together
Simply running `sbt clean compile test assembly` will clean, compile and test all the sub-projects and generate a *fat-jar* only for our two *deliverable* sub-projects.
