Very often we deal with `Future[A]`, `List[A]` and `Either[A, B]` types but, when it comes to composing them, things can get messy.

I find it easier to understand with a real-world-*ish* example.

## The context

Consider the following model for a `Commit`, an `Author` and their product `CommitAndAuthor`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=Model.scala"></script>

And let's assume we have the following methods already in place:

* `getCommits`: get all commits from a repository
* `getAuthor`: get the Author of a specific commit

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=GithubApi.scala"></script>

## The task

Now that we can retrieve all the commits and the author of a specific commit, let's try to provide all the commits **with** their authors:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=Compose.scala"></script>

## Approach #1 - Using vanilla Scala

So we *just* need to retrieve all the commits and, for each one, retrieve its author and then combine both commit and author.

We can start with the easiest part, the innermost author retrieval from the list of commits:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=FirstApproachInner.scala"></script>

So now we have a `List[Future[Either[A, B]]]` but we need it to be a `Future[Either[A, List[B]]]` after we combine it with the result of `search()`.

First of all we'll use `Future`'s `sequence` traversal to reduce many `Future`s to a single `Future`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=FirstApproachSequence.scala"></script>

From the current `Future[List[Either[A, B]]]` we need to convert it to a `Future[Either[A, List[B]]` and we'll do so by mapping over the `Future` and then folding the `List` into a single `Either` containing a `List[CommitAndAuthor]`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=FirstApproachFold.scala"></script>

And finally, we have to compose the result of calling `search()` with this previous code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=FirstApproach.scala"></script>

which, if we expand the `listCommitsAndAuthor` function, would look like:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=FirstApproachExpanded.scala"></script>

Ok then, we got it but, even though it works as expected, it's kind of verbose and there's more boilerplate code than actual *logic*.

## Approach #2 - Using monad transformers

Most code from the previous approach focuses on mapping over `Future` and `Either` to manipulate the underlaying data structures, and here's where monad transformers come into play.

We'll use the datatypes from [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats), a [Typelevel](http://typelevel.org/) project providing a lightweight, modular and extensible library for functional programming.

We can take advantage of `EitherT`, a monad transformer for `Either`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=EitherT.scala"></script>

`EitherT`'s `flatMap` will apply both `Future` and `Either`'s `flatMap` functions so we don't have to, and it will preserve their short-circuiting nature either (pun intended) if `Future` fails or `Either` is `Left`.

To extract the value from an `EitherT` instance we just need to call the `value` function, which will transform it back to a `Future[Either[A, B]]` instance.

### Refactoring

Now we can rewrite `listCommitsAndAuthor`, the innermost function, as:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=SecondApproachInner.scala"></script>

Since we're composing `Future` and `Either` we need a couple of imports from `Cats` and an `ExecutionContext`.

We are left with a `List[Either[A, B]]`. Then, using the `sequenceU` method we can traverse the `List` and transform it into an `Either[List[A, B]]`:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=SecondApproachTraverse.scala"></script>

Notice that since we are now also composing `List`s, we need a couple more imports from `Cats`.

Finally we can compose the call to `search()`, wrapped in an `EitherT` as well, with the previous code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/6bb41c132da822cce2020827d6163cc9.js?file=SecondApproach.scala"></script>

## In conclusion

Now we have a much cleaner implementation which let's you focus on the relevant logic and gently hides all the boilerplate code related to the composition of the monads.
