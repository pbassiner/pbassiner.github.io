After working in several Scala projects you are likely to end up with a minimal *seed* (kind of a project template) that you'll use whenever you start a new project.

Part of this *seed* would include some general-purpose sbt plugins, and these are the ones I'd pick.

## Keeping all your dependencies under control

### sbt-updates
It's always ideal to have your dependencies updated to the latest release. To automate that, [sbt-updates](https://github.com/rtimush/sbt-updates) can check maven repositories for dependency updates on your project dependencies (there is also a limited support for Ivy repositories hosted on BinTray).

Running the `dependencyUpdates` command displays the currently available updates:
```
> dependencyUpdates
Found 14 dependency updates for project
  com.typesafe:config                             : 1.3.0     -> 1.3.1
  ch.qos.logback:logback-classic                  : 1.1.10    -> 1.2.1
  org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j                        : 1.7.22    -> 1.7.23

  com.h2database:h2                               : 1.4.192   -> 1.4.193
  com.zaxxer:HikariCP                             : 2.5.1     -> 2.6.0
  org.scalatest:scalatest                         : 3.0.1     -> 3.2.0-SNAP4
  com.typesafe.akka:akka-stream-testkit           : 2.4.16    -> 2.4.17
```

### sbt-dependency-graph
Every now and then you might need to inspect the transitive dependencies in your project, especially when there are clashes and evictions. [sbt-dependency-graph](https://github.com/jrudolph/sbt-dependency-graph) creates a dependency graph including that information.

Running the `dependencyGraph` command will output all the dependencies in an ASCII tree graph:
```
> dependencyGraph
...
+-com.typesafe.akka:akka-stream_2.12:2.4.16 [S]
  +-com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor_2.12:2.4.16 [S]
  | +-com.typesafe:config:1.3.0 (evicted by: 1.3.1)
  | +-com.typesafe:config:1.3.1
  | +-org.scala-lang.modules:scala-java8-compat_2.12:0.8.0 [S]
  |
  +-com.typesafe:ssl-config-core_2.12:0.2.1 [S]
  | +-com.typesafe:config:1.2.0 (evicted by: 1.3.1)
  | +-com.typesafe:config:1.3.1
  | +-org.scala-lang.modules:scala-parser-combinators_2.12:1.0.4 [S]
  |
  +-org.reactivestreams:reactive-streams:1.0.0
...
```

## Keeping the code clean

### sbt-scalariform
No matter what your formatting conventions are, avoid relying on manual enforcement is paramount. The main feature of [sbt-scalariform](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-scalariform) is that it automatically formats the source code on the specified build stages, using [Scalariform](https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform).

### scalastyle-sbt-plugin
Even if the source code is automatically formatted, having a static style checker like [scalastyle-sbt-plugin](https://github.com/scalastyle/scalastyle-sbt-plugin) allows to generate a report to visually inspect the analysis.

### sbt-wartremover
In addition to the standard library warnings, [sbt-wartremover](https://github.com/wartremover/wartremover) adds more validations during the compile stage to enforce better coding conventions such as usage of `null` and `asInstanceOf` or non-final case classes, for instance. Here's the list of all [supported validations](http://www.wartremover.org/doc/warts.html).

### sbt-scoverage
In order to have a summary of the amount of code covered by unit tests, [sbt-scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage) provides code coverage reports in HTML and XML:

## Preparing to release

### sbt-native-packager
[sbt-native-packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager) lets you generate application packages in native formats. It supports universal `zip`, `tar.gz` and `xz` archives, `deb` and `rpm` for Debian/RHEL, `dmg` for OSX, `msi` for Windows and, *drumroll*, `docker` images.

## Usage
In your CI jobs you can take advantage of most of these sbt plugins to generate everything you need in one go:
```
sbt clean compile coverage test scalastyle coverageReport coverageOff docker:publish
```
This sequence of sbt commands will:
* Clean the generated target
* Compile
* Enable scoverage to instrument the code
* Run the tests
* Generate the scalastyle report
* Generate the code coverage report
* Disable scoverage to remove instrumentation (**this step is mandatory if there are further build steps, since it would use instrumented code otherwise**)
* Build and publish the corresponding docker image

Do you regularly use any other sbt plugins? Please share!
