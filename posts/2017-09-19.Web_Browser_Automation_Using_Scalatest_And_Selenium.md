This is the first blog post of the series about web browser automation using [Scalatest](http://www.scalatest.org/) and [Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) from the perspective of testing.

# Scalatest
[Scalatest](http://www.scalatest.org/) is the *de facto* standard testing library for Scala. Some other well known alternatives are [specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) and [ÂµTest](https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest).

Scalatest is simple but yet powerful and flexible. It offers several testing styles including xUnit-like, BDD and property-based testing.

Take a look at this minimal example, taken from their user guide:

# Selenium
Selenium Webdriver provides an API to automate browsers in several languages, including Java.

This example is extracted from their documentation:
