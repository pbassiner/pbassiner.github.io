This is the first blog post of the series about web browser automation using [Scalatest](http://www.scalatest.org/) and [Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) from the perspective of testing.

# Scalatest
[Scalatest](http://www.scalatest.org/) is the *de facto* standard testing library for Scala. Some other well known alternatives are [specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) and [ÂµTest](https://github.com/lihaoyi/utest).

Scalatest is simple but yet powerful and flexible. It offers several testing styles including xUnit-like, BDD and property-based testing.

Take a look at this minimal example, taken from their user guide:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/fbae9ca56ce7c61d446a88327eccf205.js?file=ScalatestExample.scala"></script>

One nice feature, that makes tests more concise and easier to write and maintain, are the matchers: a DSL for expressing assertions in tests using the word `should`. For example:
* `result should equal (3)`
* `result should have length 3`
* `string should fullyMatch regex """(-)?(\d+)(\.\d*)?"""`
* `List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) should contain oneOf (5, 7, 9)`

# Selenium
Selenium Webdriver provides an API to automate browsers in several languages, including Java.

This example is extracted from their documentation:

# Scalatest + Selenium
The Selenium DSL for Scalatest follows the same principles and makes using Selenium very straightforward.

This is the re-write of the previous example using scalatest:
