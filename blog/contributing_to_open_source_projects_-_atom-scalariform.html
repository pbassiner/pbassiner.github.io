<p>For instance, I added support for <a href="http://slick.lightbend.com/">Slick</a> 3.x to <a href="https://github.com/muuki88/sbt-slick">sbt-slick</a>, an <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">Sbt</a> plugin to generate Slick table schemas from the database schema definition in its own DDL, because version 3.x wasn't supported yet.</p>
<p>Likewise, I added support for <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> 2.11 to <a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-async-httpclient">swagger-async-httpclient</a>, which automates the code generation of a Scala HTTP asynchronous client from a <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> API definition.</p>
<p>My last contribution was shortly after I began to write this blog, so I thought it was something worth to blog about.</p>
<h2>Context</h2>
<p>While writing a <a href="https://pbassiner.github.io/blog/my_dev_setup.html">previous post</a> on this blog I was making some changes to the script I use to generate it. It's written in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> but it uses <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/Ammonite">Ammonite</a>, which allows to compile and execute Scala code without setting up a whole project nor requiring a build tool.</p>
<p>This means I <em>can't</em> use an IDE to edit it. Although I technically could, it would require to setup a Scala project (including dependency management and such) and that would go against the whole point of using Ammonite.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> instead but, nevertheless, I didn't want to give up all the features you get for free from an IDE. So I looked for some Atom packages that could help providing, at least, Scala source code highlighting and formatting. I found <a href="https://github.com/atom-community/language-scala">language-scala</a> for highlighting and <a href="https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform">atom-scalariform</a> for formatting.</p>
<h2>The issue</h2>
<p>The highlighting worked as expected but when I tried to format the blog-generator script I got an error saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You do not have a valid scala file open!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that was somehow reasonable. Ammonite scripts are not <em>standard</em>; moreover, files have <strong>.sc</strong> extension instead of <strong>.scala</strong>.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Out of curiosity I took a look at the <a href="https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform">atom-scalariform</a> repository to check out the Atom plugin code. I assumed that it would be easy to spot the file extension validation section and it was indeed. The code responsible for the validation was, at that time, the following:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad.js?file=atom-scalariform_pre_ammonite_support.js"></script>
<figcaption><a href="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad#file-atom-scalariform_pre_ammonite_support-js">https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad#file-atom-scalariform_pre_ammonite_support-js</a></figcaption>
<p>Then I looked for the Atom plugins local folder (<code>~/.atom/packages/</code>) and saw there was a sub-folder for each Atom plugin I had installed. And within the <code>atom-scalariform</code> folder, the same file structure I just saw in the repository. So I opened the <code>atom-scalariform.js</code> file and added <strong>.sc</strong> as a valid file extension:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad.js?file=atom-scalariform_post_ammonite_support.js"></script>

<p>Finally I rebooted Atom and <em>voil√†!</em> Formatting the Ammonite script was successful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Formatted scala file!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Digging deeper</h2>
<p>Formatting was working but I wanted to customize it. Since the script deals with HTML entities using <a href="https://github.com/lihaoyi/scalatags">scalatags</a> I wanted the code to be formatted accordingly:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad.js?file=scalatags_example_html_indentation.scala"></script>
<figcaption><a href="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad#file-scalatags_example_html_indentation-scala">https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad#file-scalatags_example_html_indentation-scala</a></figcaption>
<p>Digging into the scalariform documentation I found that it should be supported through the <code>danglingCloseParenthesis</code> <a href="https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform#danglingcloseparenthesis">property</a>. So following atom-scalariform <a href="https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform/blob/master/README.md">README</a> I created a <code>scalariform.properties</code> file and set it up as follows:</p>
<pre><code>preserveDanglingCloseParenthesis=true
</code></pre>
<p>I formatted the script again and it kept the HTML-<em>like</em> indentation intact, but I wasn't satisfied quite yet.</p>
<p>I had to define the path to my <code>scalariform.properties</code> file in the plugin configuration as an absolute path, which then would be applied to any file.</p>
<p>Even though is common to have a formatting standard per language, I think it's convenient to have a per-project basis configuration so you can make minor adaptations in specific projects.</p>
<h2>Improving</h2>
<p>I thought that it'd be nice to be able to configure the properties file path to be relative to the current project folder. So again, back to the plugin code, I realized there was no hint of how could I do that and, after <em>googling</em> a bit, I came up with this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad.js?file=atom-scalariform_getProjectPath.js"></script>
<figcaption><a href="https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad#file-atom-scalariform_getprojectpath-js">https://gist.github.com/pbassiner/c8afc3af6f591702bf173354fa7859ad#file-atom-scalariform_getprojectpath-js</a></figcaption>
<p>Then I added a new property <code>relativeToProject</code> to the plugin configuration and used it in the formatting process accordingly. I tested both configurations, relative and absolute, and it worked fine.</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>During the process I was already considering contributing to the project so I jumped back to the plugin repository and reviewed the <code>README</code> file looking for any indications on how to contribute, and I also checked out if there were any tests that I should update or even add some new ones. I found none, so I was practically done.</p>
<p>I forked the repository, made two branches (one for the Ammonite scripts support and another for the properties file path) since these were independent improvements, updated the <code>README</code> file in each of them and created the PRs:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform/pull/2">add support for ammonite scripts *.sc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform/pull/3">scalariform props file absolute/relative path flag</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Follow up</h2>
<p>Several days later, the project maintainer <a href="https://github.com/jackhopner">Jack Hopner</a> kindly merged the first PR right away and asked for some improvements on the second one. I proposed to simplify the configuration by removing the <code>relativeToProject</code> property and then considering the path to the <code>scalariform.properties</code> file to be an absolute path if it starts with a <code>/</code> or a relative path otherwise.</p>
<p>After applying those changes, the second PR was also merged and both contributions were included in the <code>1.0.0</code> <a href="https://github.com/jackhopner/atom-scalariform/releases/tag/v1.0.0">release</a> of the Atom plugin, which was published shortly after.</p>
<h2>Enjoy</h2>
<p>That's it, now I'm running Atom with a plugin that contains some code I wrote myself.</p>
